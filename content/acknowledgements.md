# Acknowledgements

This template uses [Just The Docs](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/) Jekyll theme.

A version of this template was developed for a workshop for the Western Association of Map Libraries presented by Evan Thornberry (UBC) and Phil White (CU Boulder).

Much of this template is heavily influenced by the University of British Columbia Library Research Commons, and several UBC affiliates contributed to the styling of this template and example pages--particularly [Evan Thornberry](https://github.com/ect123).
