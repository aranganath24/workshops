I prepared this lesson plan for a brief workshop on making basic web maps in R that [Phil White](https://outpw.github.io/teaching) and I taught at CU Boulder in the spring of 2021. To see materials associated with other parts of the workshop (authored by Phil), please see [here](https://outpw.github.io/GIS-workshops/Web-mapping/web-mapping-workshop.html).
